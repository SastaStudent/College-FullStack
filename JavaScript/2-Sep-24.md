```
It is a client side programming language
This is only language that is understand by Browser
There are no data types in JS to store data
we used keywords
like (let,var,const)

we can re-declared var (variables)
but we can re-declared let variables


we used typeof operator to see the datatype of any variables

arithmetic operators (+,=,*,/,%)

object
Boolean
Number
String


Unary operator
Relational Operator
Ternary Operator
logical
Assignment
Bitwise 


== only check value
=== check value and data types

```

```javascript
    document.write()
    document.writeln()//to write directly on html document
    let s1='abcd'
    let s2=123;
    let s3=s1+s2;
    console.table(s3,typeof(s3))//datatype is string
```
